# Active Directory Labs – Windows 11

## Overview
This lab simulates a small enterprise Active Directory environment. I deployed a Windows Server domain contoller, joined Windows 11 Pro client machines to the domain, created users and groups, and enforced security and configuration setting using Group Policy. The goal was to gain hands on experience with real world Windows domain administration and access control.

## Skills Demonstrated

Domain Controller is operational and managing domain services.

- Active Directory Setup
A functional Active Directory environment was successfully created with well-structured users, groups, and organizational units. Administration was performed using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), demonstrating practical enterprise IT skills applicable to Desktop Support and Junior System Administrator roles.

- Group Policy Management
Group Policy Objects were successfully created and applied to
Organizational Units, ensuring consistent configuration and improved
management of domain-joined  Windows 11 systems.

Windows file sharing and NTFS permissions were successfully configured to
meet multiple business scenarios. Access was controlled using security
groups and permission layering to provide secure and efficient file access
across departments.
