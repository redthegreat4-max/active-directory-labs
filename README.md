# Active Directory Labs – Windows 11

## Overview
This lab simulates a small enterprise Active Directory environment. I deployed a Windows Server domain contoller, joined Windows 11 Pro client machines to the domain, created users and groups, and enforced security and configuration setting using Group Policy. The goal was to gain hands on experience with real world Windows domain administration and access control. Screenshots are actively being added as the lab is being finalize.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
Domain Controller is operational and managing domain services.

- Active Directory Setup
A functional Active Directory environment was successfully created with well-structured users, groups, and organizational units. Administration was performed using Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), demonstrating practical enterprise IT skills applicable to Desktop Support and Junior System Administrator roles.

- Windows 11 Administration

- Group Policy Management
Group Policy Objects were successfully created and applied to
Organizational Units, ensuring consistent configuration and improved
management of domain-joined  Windows 11 systems.

- Domain Controller

- NTFS and Share
Windows file sharing and NTFS permissions were successfully configured to
meet multiple business scenarios. Access was controlled using security
groups and permission layering to provide secure and efficient file access
across departments.

- Access Based Enumeration
IT users see **only the IT folder** - HR folder is hidden - HR users see **only the HR folder** --- ## Result Access-Based Enumeration was successfully implemented to restrict folder visibility based on NTFS permissions. This configuration improves security, reduces user confusion, and mirrors a real-world enterprise file server setup.

- Effective Permissions
Effective permissions were successfully configured using inheritance,
explicit permissions, and deny rules to control access to sensitive data.
This lab demonstrates real-world permission management techniques used in
enterprise Windows environments.
